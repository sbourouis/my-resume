  <span class="mat-accent">25 years old </span>  / <span class="mat-accent">Sydney</span>
  
    <p>Native french Angular developer seeking for a short-term contract in Sydney. <br>
    Very interested in new technologies, I initially followed a general computer science training, then I specialized in web technologies during my 3 years apprenticeship. <br>
    I used those skills in the Research and Development department of IRCAD where I could master Angular and Node.js. <br>
    Iâ€™m a very curious person by nature and I am motivated to develop myself in web development. I am open to every project in which I could invest and use my skills.
