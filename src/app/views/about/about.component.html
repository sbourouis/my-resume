      <p>Native french Angular developer seeking for a short-term contract in Sydney. <br>
      Very interested in new technologies, I initially followed a general computer science training, then I specialized in web technologies during my 3 years apprenticeship. <br>
      I used those skills in the Research and Development department of IRCAD where I could master Angular and Node.js. <br>
      Iâ€™m a very curious person by nature and I am motivated to develop myself in web development. I am open to every project in which I could invest and use my skills.
